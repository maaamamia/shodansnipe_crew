**An agentic attack-surface-management console.** A CrewAI team plans Shodan
searches from your scope, confirms what's live with stealthy Nmap scans,
triages hosts for a human specialist, cross-references CVEs, and writes an
executive threat report — with human-in-the-loop controls at every step.

```
You set a scope  →  A team of AI agents works it  →  A prioritised threat report
org:"Acme Corp"      Recon → Nmap → Vuln → Report     + a hand-off list of the
hostname:acme.com    (Manager orchestrates)           hosts a human should test
net:203.0.113.0/24                                     intensively
```

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

| Need | Version / note |
|------|----------------|
| Python | **3.12** (CrewAI wheel compatibility — not 3.11 or 3.13) |
| Shodan API key | free key works; paid unlocks `vuln:` and higher limits |
| LLM key | Anthropic, OpenAI, **or** local Ollama (no key) |
| nmap | only for the active-recon stage — `choco/apt/brew install nmap` |

### Install

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run (two terminals)

```bash
# Terminal 1 — start the server
cd core
python server.py            # prompts for a DB passphrase on first run

# Terminal 2 — run the crew
cd launchers
setup_crewai.bat            # one-time: venv + deps + nmap check (Windows)
crewai.bat anthropic        # reads scope + autonomy mode from the UI
```

Open the console at **http://127.0.0.1:8000**.

> Open the console at the exact URL the server prints. Opening `index.html` as a
> file, or from a different dev server, will break the API calls.

The key architectural point: **the crew does not import the server.** They are
separate processes that talk over HTTP (REST + the `/mcp` endpoint). That's why
you start the server first, then run the crew.

## The agent team

A pipeline of specialists, each handing off to the next. The Manager
orchestrates; a human specialist sits in the middle for intensive testing.

```
MANAGER ──────────────── validates scope, enforces order, dedups, final report
   │
   ├─ RECON SPECIALIST ──── passive recon: maps the attack surface (Shodan)
   │
   ├─ NMAP RECON ────────── active recon: confirm live + triage
   │                        hands a prioritised list to →
   │                        ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
   │                        │  SENIOR NETWORK OPERATOR  (human)    │
   │                        │  intensive manual testing on HIGH    │
   │                        └─────────────────────────────────────┘
   │
   ├─ VULN ANALYST ──────── CVE cross-reference, detection queries, severity
   │
   └─ REPORT WRITER ─────── synthesises everything into the executive report
```

| Agent | File | Tools | Output |
|-------|------|-------|--------|
| **Recon Specialist** | `recon_agent.py` | shodan_search, set_scope, get_scope | in-scope live hosts + risk |
| **Nmap Recon** | `nmap_recon_agent.py` | nmap_discovery_scan, nmap_triage | HIGH/MED/LOW hand-off list |
| **Vuln Analyst** | `vuln_agent.py` | cve_intel, shodan_search, get_results | CVE detection queries + verdict |
| **Report Writer** | `report_agent.py` | get_results, get_history | executive threat report |

Every agent is a standalone module exporting `build_<name>_agent(llm)` and
`build_<name>_tasks(...)`. They are reusable, individually testable, and
individually runnable. See `docs/TEAM.md` for full roster cards.

The production orchestrator (`launchers/poc_crew.py`) additionally runs a
Manager and a dynamic Researcher with a 14-16 search credit-aware plan; the
`agents/example_crew.py` is a minimal reference that assembles Recon → Vuln →
Report.

### Run one agent in isolation

```python
from recon_agent import build_recon_agent, build_recon_tasks
from crewai import Crew, Process, LLM
llm = LLM(model="gpt-4o-mini")
agent = build_recon_agent(llm)
tasks = build_recon_tasks(agent, "Acme Corp", 'org:"Acme Corp"')
Crew(agents=[agent], tasks=tasks, process=Process.sequential, verbose=True).kickoff()
```

## The web console

Served by `core/server.py` at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

| Panel | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| **AI Analyst** | Describe a goal in plain English; the AI builds a queue of scoped Shodan queries you approve before running. Has a persistent Guidance field and an inline scope-setter. |
| **Query Builder** | Direct Shodan input with a filter library, templates, a live syntax validator, and diff mode. Picking a filter maps it to the active scope. |
| **Results** | SOURCE selector (Current / All History / By Scope) + a filter bar: Risk, Scope, Port, Org, Country, Product, CVE, ASN. Sort, column picker, CSV/JSON export. |
| **History** | Tabs: By Search, By Scope, Saved, Audit. |
| **Findings** | Cross-search deduplication — every host counted once with merged CVEs/ports, grouped by Risk/Search/Org/Port, CSV export. |
| **MCP Config** | Autonomy mode (HITL/Scoped/Full), scope enforcement, usage + token-cost meter, external MCP servers. |
| **CVE Intel** | Paste any advisory → extracted CVE IDs, severity, and scoped detection queries. |

The **⚙ Config** dropdown (top-right) has three tabs: **Scope** (multi-tag
builder + free-form query), **API Key** (Shodan key + server URL), **AI Model**
(provider, model picker, key, live cost estimate, test-connection).

---

## Scope configuration

Open **⚙ Config → Scope**. Add any mix of target types:

| Input | Becomes |
|-------|---------|
| `Acme Corp` | `org:"Acme Corp"` |
| `acme.com` | `hostname:acme.com` |
| `203.0.113.0/24` | `net:203.0.113.0/24` |
| `AS64512` | `AS64512` |
| free-form box | appended verbatim (e.g. `http.title:"Login" country:US`) |

All terms combine into one query, shown live in the preview. Scope is stored
server-side, so the console, the crew, and `crewai.bat` all share the same
target. Picking a filter from the builder, and every AI-generated query, is
auto-scoped to this target.

---

## The Nmap recon stage

Sits between passive Shodan recon and the human specialist. It confirms what's
*actually* live (Shodan data can be stale), then produces a ranked hand-off so
the specialist spends intensive-testing time where it matters.

- **Stealthy by default** — SYN scan, `-T2` timing, top-100 ports.
- **Discovery only** — no exploits, no brute force, no intrusive scripts.
- **Scope enforced in code** — refuses to scan any IP outside the active scope.
- **Capped** — max 10 hosts per call, with timeouts.

Toggle it:

```bat
set ENABLE_NMAP=1     REM active scanning ON (default if nmap installed)
set ENABLE_NMAP=0     REM passive Shodan only
```

The triage output ranks hosts HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW and recommends what the
specialist should look at first — the intensive-testing decision stays human.

---

## Autonomy modes

Set in **MCP Config → Settings**, or override on the command line. The mode is
stored server-side and read by `crewai.bat` at startup.

| Mode | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| **HITL** (default) | every action requires your `y/n` approval |
| **Scoped** | auto-approves actions within the defined scope |
| **Full Auto** | no prompts; bat asks for written confirmation; audit log always on |

```bat
crewai.bat anthropic          REM mode from the UI
crewai.bat anthropic scoped   REM override to scoped
crewai.bat anthropic full     REM override to full auto
```

---

## MCP server

`core/server.py` exposes a JSON-RPC 2.0 MCP endpoint at
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp` with six tools: `shodan_search`, `get_results`,
`get_scope`, `set_scope`, `get_history`, `cve_intel`.

**Claude Desktop / Cursor / Windsurf:**
```json
{ "mcpServers": { "shodansnipe": { "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp" } } }
```

**CrewAI (auto tool discovery):** see `agents/example_crew_mcp.py` — it uses
`MCPServerAdapter` to discover all six tools without writing wrappers.

---

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | — | Anthropic key (set before running the crew) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | — | OpenAI key |
| `OLLAMA_URL` | `http://localhost:11434/v1` | local Ollama endpoint |
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | `openai` | `anthropic` / `openai` / `ollama` |
| `SHODANSNIPE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8000` | server URL the crew talks to |
| `SHODANSNIPE_PASSPHRASE` | *(prompt)* | DB passphrase — set to skip the prompt |
| `MCP_AUTONOMY_MODE` | `hitl` | `hitl` / `scoped` / `full` |
| `ENABLE_NMAP` | `1` | `0` = passive Shodan only |
| `TARGET_ORG` / `TARGET_SCOPE` | *(from server)* | set automatically by `crewai.bat` |
| `CVE_ADVISORY` | — | optional CVE text for the Vuln Analyst |

Set permanently in PowerShell:
```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY","sk-ant-...","User")
```

See `docs/CREWAI_SETUP.md` for the full env-var walkthrough.

## Extending the system

Adding a capability is always the same shape:

1. **Tool** — a `BaseTool` in `tools/` (see `skills/BUILDING_TOOLS.md`)
2. **Agent** — a module in `agents/` exporting `build_*_agent` / `build_*_tasks`
   (see `skills/BUILDING_AGENTS.md`)
3. **Wire it** — import and insert into `launchers/poc_crew.py` at the right
   pipeline position
4. **Test in isolation**, then run the full crew

The four agents are your worked examples — copy their shape. Safety rules:
enforce scope in code (not just prompts), return strings from tools (never
raise), and keep destructive/intensive actions under human control.

---

## Troubleshooting

**`Unexpected token` / functions "not defined" in the console**
A stale `static/index.html` is being served. Replace it and hard-refresh
(Ctrl+Shift+R).

**Console can't reach the API / 404 HTML page**
You opened the page from the wrong origin. Use the exact URL the server prints
(`http://127.0.0.1:8000`). Or set the server URL in ⚙ Config → API Key.

**`crewai.bat` shows `LLM: -anthropic`**
Drop the leading dash: `crewai.bat anthropic`, not `-anthropic`.

**Autonomy stuck on HITL after picking Scoped in the UI**
Confirm the server has the endpoint: `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/config/autonomy`.

**`ImportError` for `db`, `scope`, `diff_store`, or `query_advisor`**
These are local `core/` modules. Copy your existing copies into `core/`
alongside `server.py`. See `DEPENDENCIES.md`.

**`[NMAP] disabled` when you expected it on**
Either `ENABLE_NMAP=0` or nmap isn't installed/on PATH. Install nmap or run
passive-only.

**`litellm: could not pre-load bedrock-runtime` warnings**
Harmless — `botocore` isn't installed and you aren't using Bedrock.
